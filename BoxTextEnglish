KIASER
Imagine yourself in the year 1700. 
You are the ruler of a German clan state. 
Trade in grain and land and determine all economic and social factors. 
The more successful you are, the higher you rise in the hierarchy of aristocratic titles. 
But also worry about the security of your state. 
Perhaps other rulers begrudge you your success.  
However, you can build up an army to protect yourself. 
When your land is large enough and you have accumulated sufficient capital reserves, you can start building your palace. 
When the palace is completed, you will finally be awarded the title of king. 
Now the road to becoming emperor is not far away. 
However, this depends largely on the strength of your troops. 
Once you have reached an agreement with your rivals, the time has come to build your cathdral, where you will be crowned EMPEROR of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. 
Learn with up to 9 players about the connections between economic development and military build-up in the 17th century. 
And all this in an elaborate color graphic that makes KAISER one of the best simulation games you have ever seen.
